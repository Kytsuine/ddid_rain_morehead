# Tennessee Early Intervention System
[The Tennessee Early Intervention System (TEIS)](https://www.tn.gov/didd/for-consumers/tennessee-early-intervention-system-teis.html) is a program that provides services to children ages birth up to age three who have disabilities or other developmental delays.

The U.S. Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) requires all state early intervention and preschool special education agencies to report data on three child outcomes:  
A. Positive social-emotional skills, including social relationships  
B. Acquisition and use of knowledge and skills, including early language/communication and early literacy  
C. Use of appropriate behaviors to meet their needs.  

These outcomes are summarized into Early Childhood Outcomes (ECO), which measures the percent of infants/toddlers demonstrating improvement on the three outcomes.

In the "TN Trends by SS" tab of the Excel Spreadsheet you have been provided, you will find summary tables and chart of outcomes data by assessment instrument both for Tennessee and nationally. Your primary goal in this project is to investigate Outcome B: "Acquisition and Use of Knowledge of Skills", which since 2015-2016, has not been following the same patterns exhibited by the other two outcomes.

The outcomes data is based on the Assessment, Evaluation, and Programming System for Infants and Children (AEPS), which is administered every six months in conjunction with the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) review cycle. The raw AESP data is located in the "AEPS 2017-2022" sheet. Columns T through JH contain the individual items. 

Scoring for these items is as follows:
* 0 = This skill is not yet exhibited
* 1 = This skill is emerging but not consistently exhibited
* 2 = This skill is mastered and consistently exhibited across settings and situations

These items can be matched to ECO outcome B using the "AEPS to ECO Crosswalk" tab.

Your primary object in this project is to explore the items that contribute to the acquisition and use of knowledge and skills outcome to see if there is a particular domain or item that is driving the observed trends. Report the following:
* A breakdown of scoring for those individual items.
* Which items result in the lowest scores?
* Which items have the highest scores?
* Are there any trends in the scoring of these individual test items by point of entry (as determined by the District colum) or evaluator (as indicated by the examiner column)?

Additional question:
* Look at the trend in the outcome B AEPS scores vs. duration of time receiving services (as determined by the ECO_Entry_DATE and Test Date columns). Which items show the largest improvement over time and which do not show as large an improvement?
